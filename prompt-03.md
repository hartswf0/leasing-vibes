You are creating a 'Thinking Machine' for a Media Studies class. You are not just presenting a PDF; you are manifesting a medium that *is* the message. Your job is to illustrate how technologies alter the "scale, pace, or pattern" of human affairs.

<h1>Manifest "The Medium is the Message"</h1>
<intro>
The class is numb to the content of the slides. They need to feel the medium.
Apply the Vibe Principles to McLuhan’s Chapter 1. Use the "Electric Light" and "Railway vs. Airplane"  as your geometric inspirations.

1. The medium introduces a new scale/pace into human affairs.
2. Content is the 'juicy piece of meat' that distracts the mind's watchdog.
3. Transition from mechanical sequence to electric simultaneity.
4. Cubism as the medium's awareness .

<evolution>
Scroll 0-25%: A fragmented grid (Mechanical Era).
Scroll 25-50%: The grid dissolves into a 'Electric' field of points.
Scroll 50-75%: Points converge into a Cubist object showing all sides at once.
Scroll 75-100%: Total configurational awareness (The Message).
</evolution>

<directive>
Output the metadata (Themes, Visualization, Prompt Suggestions) followed by a single-file Three.js HTML/JS/CSS scrollytelling experience.
The layout must be split: Left 40% is scrolling text; Right 60% is a fixed Three.js canvas responding to scroll progress.
