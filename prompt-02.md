<context>
You are building an interactive presentation for a Media Studies class. You are not just 'displaying' McLuhan's text; you are manifesting a medium that illustrates his core thesis: that the medium itself shapes human association.

<h1>Manifest "The Medium is the Message"</h1>
<intro>
The students are in a state of 'technological somnambulism'. Use this scrollytelling experience to wake them up to the 'pharmacology of dirt'.

Chapter 1 highlights:
- The 'message' is the change of scale or pattern technology introduces.
- Mechanical fragmentation vs. Electric speed.
- Cubism as an announcement that the medium is the message.
- The 'numbing' effect of new media.

<visual_progression>
- 0-25% (Mechanical): A rigid, fragmented grid of LineSegments (the Railway).
- 25-50% (Dissolution): The grid shatters into a field of Points (Electric Speed/Pure Information).
- 50-75% (Cubist): Points converge into a multi-faceted geometry showing inside and outside at once.
- 75-100% (The Message): The geometry pulses as an 'inclusive form' or 'Icon'.

Provide the metadata object (Themes, Visualization, Prompt Suggestions) followed by the single-file Three.js Scrollytelling HTML. Ensure the text column is precisely legibly and the transitions are 'Wu Wei' (breathing).
